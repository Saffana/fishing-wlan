#Phishing-wlan
Our goal is to get the victim's credentials while he is trying to connect to a website

## Introduction
The project takes place in our network course. The aim of this project is to practice and learn how a particular aspect of a network works.

This project can be sum up by several steps :
- Scan the Network and choose a victim
- Setup a MITM Attack on the Local Area Network
    - ARP Spoofing
    - DNS Spoofing
    - steal SSL certificate
- Steal credentials

##1 - What we are doing - Process
The first step of this attack is to look for a target by scanning the network, and getting his gateway. (ins√©rer capture du nmap).
Then, we can make him think that we are its gateway, in the same time, we deliver the packets toward the real gateway so that everything 
is almost invisible for the target. To make it invisible we have to forward the packet previously.
When we get our target we have to spoof the gateway of his ARP table. So when the target wants to go on the Internet she sends her packets to the hacker 

##2 - Encountered problems
###1 - What they were

###2 - How we actually dealt with them


## - Definitions
AP  : Acces Point, device necessary to connect client on a wireless network.
MITM : Man In The Middle, this attack is based on relaying secretly the communication between a client and the AP.

## - Used Programs :
    - nmap : Scan the network in order to find a target
    - arpspoof : Allows to usurp the target's gateway
    - wireshark : Network analyzer, shows all the packets flowing on the network including protocols and many informations
    - dnsspoof : Listen and intercept the target's DNS requests in order to apply a fake DNS table.
